# Retail-Recap-Quick-Alert
Sometimes while running Retail Recap, quick notifications would need to be sent out to subscribers. I used this program to quickly send important messages using a command system and the Discord API

This specific command system uses arguments separated by spaces in the command sent in the chat. The ability to add user restricted command calls is also possible. A bot token is needed for this program.
